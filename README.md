## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The course project requires to download and understand the dataset present at [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and perform various operations on the dataset to clean it up, extract relevant metrics in the dataset and write it back to a file with readable, descriptive names.

This project contains two files:
  * `run_analysis.R`: The actual script that cleans up the data and writes it into a file
  * `CodeBook.md`: The codebook that describes the type of the data that is present, steps taken to clean up the data and instructions to run `run_analysis.R`.
